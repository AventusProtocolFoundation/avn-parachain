# AvN Node

![image](./res/aventus.jpg)

Aventus Network belongs to the new generation of composable blockchain networks built for scalability and interoperability 🚀. It is capable of high transaction throughput and low and predictable transaction costs. The network currently operates as a parachain to Polkadot.

## Open Sourcing

The purpose of this repo is to gradually open-source the Aventus parachain code and also give the community the opportunity to contribute to the Aventus codebase either by providing enhancements to the already available code or contributing new pallets.

We are very keen on community engagement and contributions.
